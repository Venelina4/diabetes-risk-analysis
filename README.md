Date: June 2026

📌 Project Overview
This project explores the relationships between various medical indicators and diabetes risk using the well-known Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The analysis focuses on health metrics such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, age, and number of pregnancies — all relevant factors for diabetes prediction.

🔬 The aim is to identify key risk factors and visually explain trends using R and ggplot2.

🎯 Goals
📊 Clean and prepare real-world medical data

🧩 Engineer new categorical risk groups (e.g., BMI class, age group)

📉 Perform group-based analysis and statistical hypothesis testing

📈 Create professional, insightful visualizations

🧠 Draw conclusions with potential healthcare impact

📁 Files Included
File	Description
diabetes-analysis.Rmd	Full R Markdown file with code, analysis, and visualizations
diabetes-analysi.pdf	Rendered PDF report, ready for sharing and presentation

🧪 Tools & Technologies
R for data processing and statistical analysis

dplyr for data manipulation

ggplot2 for visualizations

reshape2 for correlation heatmap

R Markdown for reproducible reporting
